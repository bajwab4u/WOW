                        the invalidity of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties shall negotiate in
                        good faith to attempt to modify this Agreement to eliminate such prohibition, invalidity or
                        jeopardy in a manner that best ensures that this Agreement complies with applicable law, rules
                        and regulations at all times, but which, to the extent feasible and consistent with that

                <strong>Amendment and Termination of Agreement. </strong>This Agreement may be amended as stated in the
                Services Agreement. Business Associate's obligation to protect the privacy of the Protected Health
                Information is continuous and survives termination of the Services Agreement. Upon termination of the
                term of the Services Agreement, Business Associate will, if feasible, return to Covered Entity or
                destroy all Protected Health Information, in whatever form or medium (electronic medium), that Business
                Associate created or received for, from or on behalf of Covered Entity, including all copies of and any
                data or compilations derived from and allowing identification of any patient who is a subject of the
                Protected Health Information. Business Associate will complete such return or destruction within thirty
                (30) days after the effective date of the termination of the Services Agreement. Within such thirty (30)
                days, Business Associate will certify in writing to Covered Entity that such return or destruction has
                been completed and will deliver to Covered Entity the identification of any Protected Health Information
                for which return or destruction is not feasible and as to which the provisions of this Agreement shall
                continue to apply. If Covered Entity knows of a pattern of activity or practice of Business Associate
                that constitutes a material breach or violation of Business Associate’s obligations hereunder, Covered
                Entity shall give Business Associate written notice and a reasonable opportunity for Business Associate
                to cure the breach or obligation, and Covered Entity may take reasonable steps to cure the breach or end
                the violation if Business Associate fails to do so. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
                Covered Entity has determined that Business Associate has violated a material term of this Agreement,
                Covered Entity may terminate Business Associate's ongoing authority if Business Associate has failed to
                cure such violation within thirty (30) days of written notice from Covered Entity.</li>
